# Al-abdo Blood Diagnosis System 🔬🩸

## Overview
The **Al-abdo Blood Diagnosis System** is an AI-powered web application designed to assist in the diagnosis of blood-related diseases through advanced image analysis. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning, the system analyzes microscopic images of blood cells to detect abnormalities and classify potential diseases with high accuracy.

## Key Features
* **Microscope Integration:** Designed to process images captured directly from USB microscope cameras, bridging the gap between optical hardware and software analysis.
* **Massive Dataset Training:** The underlying diagnostic model is powered by a robust and diverse dataset of over **40,000 microscopic blood cell images**, ensuring reliable and accurate disease identification.
* **Interactive Web Interface:** Features a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily upload blood sample images and receive instant diagnostic reports.
* **Automated Processing:** Quickly isolates, processes, and analyzes cells to provide actionable medical insights.

## Technologies Used
* **Backend:** Python
* **Web Framework:** Flask/FastAPI (via `app.py`, `templates/`, and `static/` architecture)
* **Image Processing & AI:** (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras)
* **Environment Management:** `requirements.txt` for seamless dependency installation.
